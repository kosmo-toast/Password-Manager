# Password-Manager
It's a simple password manager that saves your passwords and then encrypts them with "Fernet."
It saves the passwords in a folder that you create.

To use it you have to open the "password manager.py" file in Visual Studio Code and run the file in the "terminal" and then have to pick an option. As an example if you want to Add a new password you write "1" in the "terminal" and then it will ask you for the "service name" which is the website/service name. As an example Discord. Then it will ask you for the username and password.
You can also retrive a password, list all services, and you can exit.
All the passwords are accessible in Visual Studio Code or in the folder where the "password manager.py" file is in.

I will maybe improve it in the future

I had to remove the "List all services" option

Explanation of the Menu Options:
1. Add a password: Lets you add a password to a specific category. If "generate" is entered for the password it will prompt you to create one with a specified length and symbol inclusion.
2. Retrieve a password: Allows retrieval of a password by category and service name.
3. View passwords by category: Displays all passwords stored within a selected category.
4. Search passwords: Searches all categories for a specified service name or keyword.
5. Generate a new password: Generates a password with specified length and option to include symbols.
6. Check password strength: Evaluates the strength of an entered password and provides improvement suggestions.
7. Exit: Ends the program

Im going to add an better password strength checker in the future!

(You can still install the old version)
