# Password-Manager
It's a simple password manager that saves youre passwords and then encrypts them with "Fernet"
It saves the passwords in a folder that you create.

To use it you have to open the "password manager.py" file in code.visualstudio.html and run the file in the "terminal" and then have to pic an option. As an example if you want to Add a new password you write "1" in the "terminal" and then it will ask you for the "service name" which is the website/service name. As an example Discord. Then it will ask you for the username and password.
You can also retrive a password, list all services, and you can exit.
All the passwords are accessable in Visual Studio Code or in the folder where the "password manager.py" file is in.
